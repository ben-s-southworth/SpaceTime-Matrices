# I'm following the tilt test case in
# [Implicit adaptive mesh refinement for 2D reduced resistive magnetohydrodynamics]
# Their domain is [-2pi,2pi]x[-5,5], but I might want to impose Neumann along x, so I'd need
# to check for an exact x==2pi condition. Rather, rescale and change the domain to [-1,1]. However,
# I also need to compute analytically the laplacian of A, and A is defined in cylindrical coordinates.
# To make the map simple (so that I can reuse the formulas for the laplacian in cyl coords), I then
# need to rescale also the y domain. That's why you find the values of 5/(2pi) ~ 0.79577471545
