- stabillity requirements of explicit methods obvious. If use too large of
dt, AMG --> infinity. 
- Also very important to use AIR with explicit. P^TAP or even AIR with V(A,A)
cycles is terrible. Need V(0,FFC) type cycle
- For AM2, cannot use classical interpolation --> blows the  residual up. Must use
AIR with 1-point. This may be a good example for modified AIR idea. 
- GMRES bug:
	No GMRES converges fine:
		srun -p pdebug -N 1 -n 16 ./driver -t 22 -o 2 -l 4 -p 3 -d 2 -nt 512 -gmres 0 -AIR 1 -Ar1 N -Ar2 FFC -Ai 100
	With GMRES DNC:
		srun -p pdebug -N 1 -n 16 ./driver -t 22 -o 2 -l 4 -p 3 -d 2 -nt 512 -gmres 1 -AIR 1 -Ar1 N -Ar2 FFC -Ai 100


- mysterious seg fault:
	+ seems to happen with o2 elements and more than 5 levels refinement
	+ does not seem to happen for o3 elements or < 5 levels of refine,ent 
	+ happens on BDF1, BDF2, BDF3, and AM2
	srun -p pdebug -N 1 -n 32 ./driver -t 13 -o 2 -l 5 -p 3 -d 2 -nt 16 -gmres 0 -AIR 1 -Ar1 A -Ar2 FFC -Ai 100
